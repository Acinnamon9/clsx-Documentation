# clsx-Documentation
Hi Guys, I made this documentation for [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) using [Pocketflow](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge.git) <br />
You can start with reading chapter 1.  <br />
In case, the flowchart diagrams dont work on GitHub, I have provided Pdfs as a fallback.  <br />
I hope you get through all the chapters.  <br />
