# Chapter 2: `ClassValue` type

In the previous chapter, [`clsx` function (main)](01__clsx__function__main__.md), we learned how `clsx` helps us build dynamic class names by taking different types of inputs. But have you ever wondered *what* exactly those "different types" are allowed to be? That's where the `ClassValue` type comes in!

Think of `ClassValue` as the rule book for what `clsx` can accept. It defines the allowed "ingredients" for our `clsx` recipe. It ensures we're only giving `clsx` things it knows how to handle, preventing unexpected errors.

## The Problem: Accepting All Kinds of Ingredients

Imagine you're a chef. You can't just throw *anything* into a dish and expect it to taste good. You need to know what ingredients are allowed and how to use them. Similarly, `clsx` needs to know what kinds of inputs it can process to build a `className` string correctly.

Without a defined "allowed ingredients" list, `clsx` might encounter data it doesn't know how to handle, leading to errors or unexpected results.

## The `ClassValue` Solution

The `ClassValue` type acts as a "gatekeeper," specifying exactly which data types `clsx` can accept. It's defined in the `clsx.d.ts` file as:

```typescript
type ClassValue = ClassArray | ClassDictionary | string | number | bigint | null | boolean | undefined;
```

Let's break down what this means:

1.  **`string`:** A plain text string, like `"button"`, `"button--primary"`, or `"my-custom-class"`. This is the most basic type.

2.  **`number`:** A numeric value. Numbers are converted to strings. For example, `clsx(123)` results in `"123"`.

3.  **`bigint`:** Similar to `number` but for very large integers. Like numbers, they're also converted to strings.

4.  **`boolean`:**  `true` becomes the string `"true"`. `false` and other "falsey" values (see below) are ignored.

5.  **`null`:** Ignored by `clsx`. It's treated as if it wasn't even there.

6.  **`undefined`:** Also ignored by `clsx`, just like `null`.

7.  **`ClassDictionary`:**  An object where the keys are class names (strings) and the values are boolean. If the value is `true`, the class name is included. If `false`, it's excluded. Think of it as a "conditional class" object.

8.  **`ClassArray`:** An array containing other `ClassValue` types. This allows you to nest class names in arrays. `clsx` will flatten this array and process each element individually.

In essence, `ClassValue` tells us that `clsx` can handle strings, numbers, booleans, objects (with boolean values), arrays of these things, and `null` or `undefined` (which it ignores).

## Usage Examples

Let's see how `ClassValue` plays out in practice with different examples, building on what we learned in [the previous chapter](01__clsx__function__main__.md).

**Example 1: String (the most common case)**

```javascript
import clsx from 'clsx';

const result = clsx('button', 'button--primary');
console.log(result); // Output: "button button--primary"
```

Here, both `'button'` and `'button--primary'` are strings, which are valid `ClassValue` types.

**Example 2: ClassDictionary (conditional classes)**

```javascript
import clsx from 'clsx';

const isActive = true;
const result = clsx({ 'button--active': isActive, 'button--disabled': !isActive });
console.log(result); // Output: "button--active"
```

The object `{ 'button--active': isActive, 'button--disabled': !isActive }` is a `ClassDictionary`. The keys are class names, and the values are booleans. Since `isActive` is `true`, `'button--active'` is included. Since `!isActive` is `false`, `'button--disabled'` is excluded.

**Example 3: ClassArray (nested arrays)**

```javascript
import clsx from 'clsx';

const baseClasses = ['button', 'button--base'];
const modifiers = ['button--large', { 'button--active': true }];
const result = clsx(baseClasses, modifiers);
console.log(result); // Output: "button button--base button--large button--active"
```

Here, we have two arrays, `baseClasses` and `modifiers`. `clsx` flattens these arrays and processes each element: strings, and objects.

**Example 4: Mixed Types**

```javascript
import clsx from 'clsx';

const isLoading = false;
const size = 10;
const result = clsx('button', { 'button--loading': isLoading }, size, null, undefined, ['button--animated']);
console.log(result); // Output: "button 10 button--animated"
```

This example demonstrates how `clsx` handles different `ClassValue` types:

-   `'button'`: A string.
-   `{ 'button--loading': isLoading }`: A `ClassDictionary`.  Since `isLoading` is `false`, `'button--loading'` is excluded.
-   `size`: Number 10, converted to the string "10".
-   `null` and `undefined`: Ignored.
-   `['button--animated']`: An array containing a string.

## Under the Hood

While `ClassValue` itself isn't a function that *executes* code, it's crucial for *type checking*. In TypeScript (the language `clsx` is written in), `ClassValue` tells the compiler what types of arguments are acceptable. If you try to pass an argument that *isn't* a `ClassValue`, TypeScript will give you an error.

Here's a simplified example of how `ClassValue` is used in the `clsx`'s definition (from `clsx.d.ts`):

```typescript
declare namespace clsx {
	type ClassValue = ClassArray | ClassDictionary | string | number | bigint | null | boolean | undefined;
	type ClassDictionary = Record<string, any>;
	type ClassArray = ClassValue[];
	function clsx(...inputs: ClassValue[]): string;
}

declare function clsx(...inputs: clsx.ClassValue[]): string;
```

The `...inputs: ClassValue[]` part is important. It says that the `clsx` function can accept *any number* of arguments, but each argument *must* be a `ClassValue`.

During runtime, the [toVal function](04__toval__function__internal__.md) then iterates over the arguments and uses logic to translate these acceptable ClassValue types into string outputs, skipping over ones that don't make sense.

## Conclusion

The `ClassValue` type defines the "rules of the game" for `clsx`. It tells us what kinds of inputs `clsx` can accept and how those inputs will be processed. By understanding `ClassValue`, you'll have a better grasp of how `clsx` works and how to use it effectively.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the [`clsx/lite` module](03__clsx_lite__module_.md), a smaller, faster version of `clsx` with some limitations on the `ClassValue` types it accepts.
